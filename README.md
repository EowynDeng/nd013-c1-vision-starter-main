# Object Detection in an Urban Environment

## Data

For this project, we will be using data from the [Waymo Open dataset](https://waymo.com/open/).

[OPTIONAL] - The files can be downloaded directly from the website as tar files or from the [Google Cloud Bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/waymo_open_dataset_v_1_2_0_individual_files/) as individual tf records. We have already provided the data required to finish this project in the workspace, so you don't need to download it separately.

## Structure

### Data

The data you will use for training, validation and testing is organized as follow:
```
/home/workspace/data/waymo
    - training_and_validation - contains 97 files to train and validate your models
    - train: contain the train data (empty to start)
    - val: contain the val data (empty to start)
    - test - contains 3 files to test your model and create inference videos
```

The `training_and_validation` folder contains file that have been downsampled: we have selected one every 10 frames from 10 fps videos. The `testing` folder contains frames from the 10 fps video without downsampling.

You will split this `training_and_validation` data into `train`, and `val` sets by completing and executing the `create_splits.py` file.

### Experiments
The experiments folder will be organized as follow:
```
experiments/
    - pretrained_model/
    - exporter_main_v2.py - to create an inference model
    - model_main_tf2.py - to launch training
    - reference/ - reference training with the unchanged config file
    - experiment0/ - create a new folder for each experiment you run
    - experiment1/ - create a new folder for each experiment you run
    - experiment2/ - create a new folder for each experiment you run
    - label_map.pbtxt
    ...
```

## Prerequisites

### Local Setup

For local setup if you have your own Nvidia GPU, you can use the provided Dockerfile and requirements in the [build directory](./build).

Follow [the README therein](./build/README.md) to create a docker container and install all prerequisites.

### Download and process the data

**Note:** ‚ÄùIf you are using the classroom workspace, we have already completed the steps in the section for you. You can find the downloaded and processed files within the `/home/workspace/data/preprocessed_data/` directory. Check this out then proceed to the **Exploratory Data Analysis** part.

The first goal of this project is to download the data from the Waymo's Google Cloud bucket to your local machine. For this project, we only need a subset of the data provided (for example, we do not need to use the Lidar data). Therefore, we are going to download and trim immediately each file. In `download_process.py`, you can view the `create_tf_example` function, which will perform this processing. This function takes the components of a Waymo Tf record and saves them in the Tf Object Detection api format. An example of such function is described [here](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training.html#create-tensorflow-records). We are already providing the `label_map.pbtxt` file.

You can run the script using the following command:
```
python download_process.py --data_dir {processed_file_location} --size {number of files you want to download}
```

You are downloading 100 files (unless you changed the `size` parameter) so be patient! Once the script is done, you can look inside your `data_dir` folder to see if the files have been downloaded and processed correctly.

### Classroom Workspace

In the classroom workspace, every library and package should already be installed in your environment. You will NOT need to make use of `gcloud` to download the images.

## Instructions

### Exploratory Data Analysis

You should use the data already present in `/home/workspace/data/waymo` directory to explore the dataset! This is the most important task of any machine learning project. To do so, open the `Exploratory Data Analysis` notebook. In this notebook, your first task will be to implement a `display_instances` function to display images and annotations using `matplotlib`. This should be very similar to the function you created during the course. Once you are done, feel free to spend more time exploring the data and report your findings. Report anything relevant about the dataset in the writeup.

Keep in mind that you should refer to this analysis to create the different spits (training, testing and validation).


### Create the training - validation splits
In the class, we talked about cross-validation and the importance of creating meaningful training and validation splits. For this project, you will have to create your own training and validation sets using the files located in `/home/workspace/data/waymo`. The `split` function in the `create_splits.py` file does the following:
* create three subfolders: `/home/workspace/data/train/`, `/home/workspace/data/val/`, and `/home/workspace/data/test/`
* split the tf records files between these three folders by symbolically linking the files from `/home/workspace/data/waymo/` to `/home/workspace/data/train/`, `/home/workspace/data/val/`, and `/home/workspace/data/test/`

Use the following command to run the script once your function is implemented:
```
python create_splits.py --data-dir /home/workspace/data
```

### Edit the config file

Now you are ready for training. As we explain during the course, the Tf Object Detection API relies on **config files**. The config that we will use for this project is `pipeline.config`, which is the config for a SSD Resnet 50 640x640 model. You can learn more about the Single Shot Detector [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf).

First, let's download the [pretrained model](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/tf2/20200711/ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8.tar.gz) and move it to `/home/workspace/experiments/pretrained_model/`.

We need to edit the config files to change the location of the training and validation files, as well as the location of the label_map file, pretrained weights. We also need to adjust the batch size. To do so, run the following:
```
python edit_config.py --train_dir /home/workspace/data/train/ --eval_dir /home/workspace/data/val/ --batch_size 2 --checkpoint /home/workspace/experiments/pretrained_model/ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8/checkpoint/ckpt-0 --label_map /home/workspace/experiments/label_map.pbtxt
```
A new config file has been created, `pipeline_new.config`.

### Training

You will now launch your very first experiment with the Tensorflow object detection API. Move the `pipeline_new.config` to the `/home/workspace/experiments/reference` folder. Now launch the training process:
* a training process:
```
python experiments/model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=experiments/reference/ --pipeline_config_path=experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config
```
Once the training is finished, launch the evaluation process:
* an evaluation process:
```
python experiments/model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=experiments/reference/ --pipeline_config_path=experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config --checkpoint_dir=experiments/reference/
```

**Note**: Both processes will display some Tensorflow warnings, which can be ignored. You may have to kill the evaluation script manually using
`CTRL+C`.

To monitor the training, you can launch a tensorboard instance by running `python -m tensorboard.main --logdir experiments/reference/`. You will report your findings in the writeup.

### Improve the performances

Most likely, this initial experiment did not yield optimal results. However, you can make multiple changes to the config file to improve this model. One obvious change consists in improving the data augmentation strategy. The [`preprocessor.proto`](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/protos/preprocessor.proto) file contains the different data augmentation method available in the Tf Object Detection API. To help you visualize these augmentations, we are providing a notebook: `Explore augmentations.ipynb`. Using this notebook, try different data augmentation combinations and select the one you think is optimal for our dataset. Justify your choices in the writeup.

Keep in mind that the following are also available:
* experiment with the optimizer: type of optimizer, learning rate, scheduler etc
* experiment with the architecture. The Tf Object Detection API [model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md) offers many architectures. Keep in mind that the `pipeline.config` file is unique for each architecture and you will have to edit it.

**Important:** If you are working on the workspace, your storage is limited. You may to delete the checkpoints files after each experiment. You should however keep the `tf.events` files located in the `train` and `eval` folder of your experiments. You can also keep the `saved_model` folder to create your videos.


### Creating an animation
#### Export the trained model
Modify the arguments of the following function to adjust it to your models:

```
python experiments/exporter_main_v2.py --input_type image_tensor --pipeline_config_path experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config --trained_checkpoint_dir experiments/reference/ --output_directory experiments/reference/exported/
```

This should create a new folder `experiments/reference/exported/saved_model`. You can read more about the Tensorflow SavedModel format [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model).

Finally, you can create a video of your model's inferences for any tf record file. To do so, run the following command (modify it to your files):
```
python inference_video.py --labelmap_path label_map.pbtxt --model_path experiments/reference/exported/saved_model --tf_record_path /data/waymo/testing/segment-12200383401366682847_2552_140_2572_140_with_camera_labels.tfrecord --config_path experiments/reference/pipeline_new.config --output_path animation.gif
```


### Project overview
The goal of this project is to classify and segement the vehicle, pedestrain, and cyclist from given waymo dataset. This is used to train the use of CNN and parameter tuning.


### Set up
This is a Udacity project being done on an on-line workspace. However, Udacity does provide setup instructions for offline build. The requiements of system are: NVIDIA GPU with latest driver and docker/nvidia-docker.

Build the image:
```
docker build -t project-dev -f Dockerfile .
```
Create container:
```
docker run --gpus all -v <PATH TO LOCAL PROJECT FOLDER>:/app/project/ --network=host -ti project-dev bash
```
install gsutil
```
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
gcloud auth login
```


### Dataset
#### Dataset analysis
The dataset contins a series of images with RGB channels. A quick visualization can be shown below. The dataset does contain different weather (sunny, cloudy, raining) and places (city, suburban, neighborhood).

![alt text](img/vehicle1.png)
![alt text](img/vehicle2.png)
![alt text](img/vehicle3.png)
![alt text](img/vehicle4.png)
![alt text](img/vehicle5.png)
![alt text](img/vehicle6.png)
![alt text](img/vehicle7.png)
![alt text](img/vehicle8.png)
![alt text](img/vehicle9.png)
![alt text](img/vehicle10.png)


#### Cross validation
To make sure the validation process works or makes sense, I've tested to make sure the sample distribution in the trianing and validation sets are similar. Below are the histogram of the distribution of number of vehicles, pedestrain, and cyclist (from left to right) for training set and validation set:

Training set distribution:

![alt text](img/training_set.png)

Validation set distribution:

![alt text](img/val_set.png)

Both have very similar distribution and should work well for the CNN network being trained.


### Training
#### Reference experiment
The experiment started with the default setting which ended in very large losses (> 10) and converge very slow (not converge after 2500 steps).

Terminal output:
![alt text](img/Training_terminal.JPG)

Loss:
![alt text](img/Loss.JPG)

Learning rate:
![alt text](img/Learning_rate.JPG)

The evaluation of the performance is focusing on Precisions and Recalls:

Precisions:
![alt text](img/Precision.JPG)

Recalls:
![alt text](img/Recall.JPG)

The precisions and recalls are very poor at this point. This may indicate some modification of the base model is needed to improve. Also, if could be trained with a larger batch size, the performance of the final model can be improved significantly.

#### Improve on the reference
To improve the performance, I used a larger batch size of 8 instead of the original 2 (though I would use a larger batch size if the online workspace has more memory allocation). A very small batch size makes the start point of the training very randomly (sometimes at a very high loss). The model was also improved by pre-process some of the images to make the model more general. The final results of the model training can be found below. The model was able to converge within 2500 steps. One thing to notice is the small backward line that happend around 1000 steps. The training was interrupted around 1600 steps, and I had to re-initiate the training process. Thus the TensorBoard is trying to link 1200 back to 1000.

I've added three pre-process to the images in the experiments/pipeline_new.config file (as shown below). The basic idea is to randomly change the RGB values (regarding brightness, contrast, and RGB2Grey) to make the dataset more various. For instance: rgb2grey can help simulate night conditions; brightness change can simulate different lighting conditions; etc.

```
  data_augmentation_options {
    random_rgb_to_gray {
    probability: 0.2
    }
  }
  data_augmentation_options {
    random_adjust_brightness {
    max_delta: 0.3
    }
  }
  data_augmentation_options {
    random_adjust_contrast {
    min_delta: 0.6
    max_delta: 1.0
    }
```

The final results can be found below:

Precisions and recalls:
![alt text](img/Precision&recall_2.JPG)

Loss and learning rate:
![alt text](img/loss&learning_rate_2.JPG)

Based on the precision and recall, the performance was significantly better with the modification mentioned above. If the training process can be allocated with more memory, I would try a larger batch size which should help further improve the performance.
